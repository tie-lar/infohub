This project was created by 4 additional members of a group of 5, for an end of year university project. We had 2-3weeks to create this. My main contributions was on the design of the application including placement of text/imagery/divs/navbar, general colour scheme, implementing swiper and routes for changing between pages, along with implementing email js for the request to post form.

I also contributed to a lot of the debugging, when errors would occur, and reorganising a lot of the code to be more structrued.
